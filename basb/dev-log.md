I tried using vue-tests utils and vite plugin vue to test my nuxt components.
Though there's an issue, the tests works but now nuxt doesn't render the home page anymore.
I think it has something to do with the fact that I added a file `vite.config.js` in the root directory, maybe overriding some internal `vite.config` file of `nuxt3`...
I'm going to investigate that...

Found [this on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72493908/how-to-write-unit-test-for-components-with-vitest-in-nuxt-3) which states that the issue was solved by providing a config file only for vitest. I'm gonna try that:
- moving the vite config file to a new name that won't cause conflict
- manually add the link to the `package.json` script.
Let's try that...
